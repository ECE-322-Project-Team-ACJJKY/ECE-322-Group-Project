## Response

To perform a static data flow analysis on the `wordle.py` file, I will:

1. **Extract All Variables**: Identify and list all the variables in the code.
2. **Track Variable Actions**: Record where each variable is defined, used in predicates, used in computations, and deleted.
3. **Detect Data Flow Anomalies**: Highlight any suspicious or erroneous usages of variables, such as:
   - **Suspicious Actions**:
     - Defined multiple times consecutively.
     - Defined and then deleted without usage.
     - Deleted multiple times consecutively.
   - **Anomalies**:
     - Deleted then used.

### Analysis

I will now proceed with the static analysis of this code.

### Step 1: Extract All Variables

Below is a list of variables identified in the code:

1. **Instance Variables (`self`)**:
   - `vocabulary`
   - `console`
   - `display`
   - `word`
   - `letter_position`
   - `max_attempts`
   - `num_attempts`
   - `attempts`
   - `alphabet`
   - `solved`
   - `failed`

2. **Local Variables**:
   - `word` (argument and local variable in `guess`)
   - `max_attempts` (constructor argument)
   - `seed` (constructor argument and local variable)
   - `today` (local)
   - `position` (local in loops)
   - `letter` (local in loops)
   - `msg` (argument in `message`)
   - `style` (argument in `message` and `show`, local in `show`)
   - `result` (local in `guess`)
   - `total_score` (local in `guess`)
   - `score` (local in `guess`)
   - `attempt` (local in loops in `show`)
   - `attempts_display` (local in `show`)
   - `alphabet_display` (local in `show`)

### Step 2: Track Variable Actions

Here is the detailed tracking of variable usage:

### Step 3: Data Flow Anomalies and Suspicious Uses

#### Anomalies

- **No deletion anomalies**: Variables are not explicitly deleted and thus are not deleted before usage.

#### Suspicious Uses

- **Redundant Definitions**: Variables like `word` (argument) are shadowed by local variables.
- **Redundant Updates**
  - `attempts[self.num_attempts].clear()` followed by `.extend()` might be unnecessary if `attempts` is re-assigned entirely.

#### Recommendations

- Avoid re-defining variables unnecessarily (e.g., `word`).
- Ensure proper handling of `attempts` to avoid redundant operations.

### Summary of Findings

The Wordle application in Python has no severe anomalies but contains minor redundant definitions and updates. These can be optimized for better readability and performance. If you would like, I can suggest further refactoring or provide specific code recommendations.

## Evalutation of Response

It missed uses of `self.vocabulary` in the constructor after definition. missed most uses of `self.word`.

It said that `word` local variable had a redundant definition due to the input argument being shadowed by a local variable, however I disagree, and the code does not have a suspicious use of `word`.

It did however correctly flag that `attempts[self.num_attempts]` was cleared then immediately extended, which is suspicious and could be replaced with one line to simply reassign the variable.

It does seem to be correct in its summary that there are no severe anomalies, and only a couple of minor suspicious definitions and updates.
